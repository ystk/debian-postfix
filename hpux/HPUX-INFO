The HP-UX build tree is currently in mid-flight.  The build should work,
but the postinst/configure scripts are still pending.  So far, the result
is UNTESTED.

The intention here is to provide an build process for hp-ux that is open-
source, and relieve me from some of my support duties there.  Starting with
a base HP-UX machine, the following need to be installed to make life happy.

From HP:
  1) HP's C-ANSI-C product.

From Debian:
  2) GNU patch
  3) GNU install (in the fileutils package)
  4) PCRE3
  5) OpenLDAP
